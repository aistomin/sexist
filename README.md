_"Sexism is bad. The name of the library is derived from the word "Sex" and my surname :)" - Andrej Istomin._
   
## Description

Java library for gender detection by person's first name. Inspired by https://github.com/ferhatelmas/sexmachine/ library for Python. Based on the data from the program "gender" by Jorg Michael (described [here](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/20260-gender-verification-by-forename-cmd-line-tool-db/))
